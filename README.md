# Tribute to Bubble Bobble

This game is a little tribute to the fantastic game Bubble Bobble.
The game is not intended to be more than a fun hobby project, all images, graphics, original idea of the game, sounds, other content belong to TAITO.

My aim for this game is:

- learn typescript and javascript
- learn how to use reactive programming with it
- how to deploy a web game

# How to build the game for developers

- clone and enter root folder
- install npm on your system
- 'npm install'
- 'npm start'
- open a browser and point to 'localhost:8080'

# How to update dependencies for developers

- 'npm install -g npm-check-updates'
- 'ncu -u'
- 'npm update'

# How to use precommit for developers

- 'pip install pre-commit'
- in root folder 'pre-commit run --all-files'
